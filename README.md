#Masters of the universe

Masters of the universe is the working title of a small webgl game being developed by Rosie Emery and Quentin Corker-Marin.

Its a fun little space shooter and we think that making it will be a lot like playing it where all the boring things in life get in your way. These things slow down our development and will try to take you down when you play too. While you can do your best to shoot down your problems, some things can't be escaped.
